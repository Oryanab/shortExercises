            * Place a console.log(“second call”) inside a setTimeout() function to be called after 2 sec  
            * Consol.log(“ third call”`)
            * What will your console output be?

      setTimeout(function () {
        console.log("second call");
      }, 2000);
      console.log("third call");

      // esimate before lunching:
      // output: first call, third call, second call
      // reason: when i lunch the program it lunches all the logs, due to the fact that the second call comes after 2 seconds it will appear last, but thats doesnt means the timeout function wasnt lunched before the third call.
      // real output:
      // Exactly as expected :first call, third call, second call
